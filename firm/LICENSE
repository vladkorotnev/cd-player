# ESPer-Project Usage License 1.0

A simpler license until I find one that suits the project the most.

## What you must:

* Retain the ESPer project name and boot logo in the software, even when using it in your own project
* Retain all the copyrights, links, as well as this license, in your own copy/fork of the project
* If building a commercial product, clearly state that it's running ESPer firmware, and provide a link to the original Github repo (https://github.com/vladkorotnev/cd-player/)

## What you can:

* Use this firmware on the ESPer-PCB v1.0 as well as your own bespoke, compatible board, stand-alone or as part of a project
* Extend this firmware to support your own board
* Build commercial products around this firmware

## What we'd love you do:

* If you're extending the firmware for your own device, please adhere to the architecture and codestyle and submit a PR upstream!
* If you're building a commercial device, please allow the end user to replace the firmware with their own, based around this repo or otherwise!
* If you're using this firmware in any way or form, let us know how you like it!
* Tell your friends about this firmware, as well as CDs and physical media in general and the compromises they have make when they prefer streaming to owning a copy! (but don't harrass them, it's their call which they wanna use)

## What you cannot do:

* Erase any of the copyrights, logos and names related to the ESPer project, in the code that was not created by you
* Harrass or mistreat any of the project members and/or contributors for any reasons, code-related or not
